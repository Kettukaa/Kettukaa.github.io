## Purpose The Site
The goal of this website is to document, organize, and present my work with machine learning. That work includes training models of the type Object-Detection, GANs, and DDPMs, with more to come.   

## Where Can You Get The Code
At the time of writing, nowhere yet. But I will be releasing my code on [my github page](https://github.com/Kettukaa) in the near future. 95% of my code are Jupyter Notebooks utilizing the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment.

## Why "Kettukaa"?
I wanted a pseudonym that had meaning that was closely linked to the primary subject of my work, foxes. So I went on Google Translate and cycled through the languages until I landed on the Finnish "Kettu." I wanted a little extra so I added the ending "kaa" for flair. 

## Webpage
This website was created through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) template. I have to give it to Github, their system with Jekyll and hosting sites works straight out of the box and is easily adaptable. 10/10.
